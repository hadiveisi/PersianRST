# Persian RST Corpus

This is the first version of the Persian RST corpus, a corpus of 150 journalistic texts annotated in the framework of Rhetorical Structure Theory [1]. The annotation was mainly based on the English RST Discourse Treebank [2] guideline [3]. The relations used in the corpus are the coarse-grained relations introduced in RST Discourse Treebank tagging guideline, which are *Span*, *Joint*, *Elaboration*, *Same*-*Unit*, *Contrast*, *Explanation*, *Attribution*, *Cause*, *Background*, *Evaluation*, *Topic*, *Comment*, *Condition*, *Temporal*, *Summary*, *Enablement*, *Comparison*, *Topic*, *Change*, *Manner*-*Means*. We have annotated the corpus using [rstweb](https://github.com/amir-zeldes/rstWeb) [4] and recommend you use this tool if you want to see RST trees graphically. The name of each file contains the source of the news; e.g. etemad001.rs3 was taken from Etemad newspaper. For more information about corpus articles, see [corpus metadata](./CorpusMetadata.pdf), which provides information about the source, date, author and link of each article.
